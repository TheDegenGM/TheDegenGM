- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheDegenGM.
- 👀 I’m interested in starting new businesses 💼, crypto 🚀 and human psychology 🧠.
- 😩 I have failed in many of my businesses - a tuition centre, a group gaming console centre and many others.
- 📖 I graduated with a degree in environmental engineering but never worked as one.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be an SQA Engineer, but am not too sure if that's what I am looking for. Nevertheless, I am happy to learn new things, make new friends, to be in a new and challenging environment and making an impact in my new work.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have worked at the Grand Canyon, Arizona in the US as an ice cream boy. I hiked down and up the Grand Canyon within a day, which was a suicidal move according to the Park Rangers.
- ✍️ My personal mantra: The only constant in life is change.
